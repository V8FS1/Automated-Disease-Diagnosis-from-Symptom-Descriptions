# 🩺 Automated Disease Diagnosis from Symptom Descriptions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **AI-powered system for predicting diseases** from **free-text, patient-style symptom descriptions** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
Unlike traditional models that rely on structured or short-text inputs, this system is designed to understand **real-world, unstructured patient language** and provide accurate predictions across **24 disease categories**.

The final pipeline integrates **transformer-based models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, RoBERTa)**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **data augmentation using LLMs**, achieving:

- ✅ **95% test accuracy**  
- ✅ **96% validation accuracy**  
- ✅ **100% Top-3 accuracy on real-world simulated patient cases**

The system is deployed in a **web interface**, making it accessible for **telemedicine and patient-facing applications**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📝 **Free-text symptom input** → handles unstructured, natural patient descriptions.  
- 🤖 **Transformer-based classification** → fine-tuned BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, PubMedBERT, and RoBERTa models.  
- 🔍 **NER-enhanced predictions** → integrates biomedical entities for improved robustness.  
- 🧠 **Data augmentation with LLMs** → expanded dataset with 240+ clinically validated symptom variations.  
- 🌐 **Web deployment** → real-time predictions with disease summaries and follow-up guidance.
