# 🩺 Automated Disease Diagnosis from Symptom Descriptions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **AI-powered system for predicting diseases** from **free-text, patient-style symptom descriptions** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
Unlike traditional models that rely on structured or short-text inputs, this system is designed to understand **real-world, unstructured patient language** and provide accurate predictions across **24 disease categories**.

The final pipeline integrates **transformer-based models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, RoBERTa)**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **data augmentation using LLMs**, achieving:

- ✅ **95% test accuracy**  
- ✅ **96% validation accuracy**  
- ✅ **100% Top-3 accuracy on real-world simulated patient cases**

The system is deployed in a **web interface**, making it accessible for **telemedicine and patient-facing applications**.

### 📓 Understanding `Disease_Ai_Pipeline.ipynb` 

The file `disease_ai_pipeline.ipynb` contains the **core training and evaluation workflow** for the AI disease prediction model. It documents each stage of the machine learning pipeline, making it easy to follow, reproduce, or extend the system.

**Key steps covered in the notebook:**
- **Data Preparation**: Load, inspect, clean, and structure the dataset for model training.  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Enhance the dataset with biomedical entities using SciSpaCy and transformer-based NER pipelines.  
- **Model Pipeline (BERT & Variants)**: Tokenization, encoding, and fine-tuning transformer models such as BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and RoBERTa.  
- **Training Process**: Train/validation/test splits, training arguments, and loss/accuracy tracking.  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate models on test data, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.  
- **Model Saving**: Save trained models and tokenizers for deployment in the web interface.  

👉 This notebook is the **heart of the AI system**, serving as both the development log and the reproducible workflow for generating disease prediction models.

## 📄 24-Disease.json
The file 24-Disease.json contains detailed information for each of the 24 diseases the model can predict. It includes:
- name → Disease name (e.g., “Acne”, “Fungal infection”).
- description → A brief overview of the disease.
- homeCare → Self-care and home remedies.
- medications → Recommended medications and their common side effects.
- lifestyle → Lifestyle tips to manage or prevent the disease.
- whenToSeeDoctor → Guidelines on when to seek professional medical attention.
  
#### The web interface uses this JSON file to display detailed disease information after a prediction. This allows the system to not only identify the disease but also provide educational and actionable guidance for users.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/V8FS1/Automated-Disease-Diagnosis-from-Symptom-Descriptions.git
   cd Automated-Disease-Diagnosis-from-Symptom-Descriptions
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
   Option A — Python venv (recommended)

   macOS / Linux
   ```bash
   # from the project root
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Windows (PowerShell)
   ```bash
   # from the project root
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
3. Database Setup
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. Launch the Development Server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## ⚙️ Using the AI Model
To use the disease prediction AI, you must download the pre-trained model files because they are not included directly in the repository (due to their large size).

### Steps to Download the Model
1. The project includes a Python script called download_model.py.
2. Run the script from your project root:
   ```bash
   python download_model.py
   ```
3. This will automatically download the required model files from Google Drive and place them in the appropriate folder (model/).
4. After downloading, the AI system is ready to use with the symptom input interface.
