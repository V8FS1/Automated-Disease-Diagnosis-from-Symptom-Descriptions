        "\n",
        "- Apply **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using biomedical NLP models to extract meaningful entities such as symptoms, conditions, and disorders.  \n",
        "- Combine these entities with the original text to enrich input features for the model.  \n",
        "- Fine-tune **Transformer-based models** (RoBERTa, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, etc.) that can capture semantic and contextual relationships in the text more effectively.  \n",
        "- Evaluate performance not only with standard metrics but also on **real-world, patient-like symptom descriptions** to ensure the model generalizes well.  \n",
